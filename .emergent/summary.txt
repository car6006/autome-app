The AI engineer systematically tackled a wide range of issues and feature enhancements for the AUTO-ME PWA. Initially, significant effort was dedicated to improving AI report formatting for Word and PDF, ensuring professional layouts with correct spacing and branding. This led to an iterative process involving frontend and backend adjustments, including a temporary shift to frontend generation before reverting to a more robust, proven backend-driven approach for comprehensive batch reports.

Key fixes included addressing rate limiting for large file uploads by increasing API limits and clearing stuck notes, and resolving critical login failures caused by a data type mismatch (float vs. integer) in productivity metrics, which required both code adjustments and direct database updates. Markdown symbols in AI-generated content were eradicated through a combination of enhanced AI prompting and post-processing. The engineer also significantly improved documentation and organized a cluttered file structure. The immediate task involves diagnosing a deployment issue where the application's  is not being served correctly.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME PWA is a zero-friction content capture application designed for guaranteed delivery and editable AI outputs. Its core features include Whisper transcription, OCR, text notes, email/Git synchronization, JWT authentication, and data isolation. The application aims to evolve with enterprise features such as IISB analysis, dynamic theming, multi-file upload, AI professional reports, and a conversational Ask AI agent.

Explicit requests and features that have been implemented or addressed so far include:
-   **Large File Transcription Reliability**: Debugged and stabilized Error loading jobs and Could not fetch transcription jobs for large uploads.
-   **Batch Report & Comprehensive Report Enhancements**: Structured output, added Ask AI Agent functionality, visual batch indicators, ensured notes are marked complete post-export. Professional reports now offer Word and PDF export with enhanced formatting and branding.
-   **Productivity Metrics**: Implemented a real-time, automatic system to track productivity gains (time saved) upon note completion, with content-length-based calculations and reasonable caps.
-   **Password Management**: Implemented a Forgot Password feature with email validation and a password reset flow, accessible from the login screen and user profile.
-   **Text/Document Formatting**: Improved paragraph and heading formatting for all text exports (TXT, RTF, DOC, AI reports, PDF) to ensure a professional layout and remove markdown symbols.
-   **Database Cleanup**: Provided and executed a mechanism to delete notes and transcription jobs, and also to correct database entry types.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Adjusted API rate limits to support heavy usage scenarios.
-   **File Organization**: Streamlined the project directory structure, moving development artifacts into dedicated folders.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React, JavaScript (), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, React Context, Axios, Yarn.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), JWT,  (for Word),  (for PDF), OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.
-   **Core Features**: Asynchronous task processing, Rate Limiting, Environment Variables, Data Type Validation (Pydantic).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with MongoDB.



-   **backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application handling API requests.
    -   **Importance**: Central API for authentication, report generation, and exports.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced Word/PDF export formatting for AI analysis reports (individual and batch), rewrote PDF logic to match Word quality. Added new endpoints for comprehensive batch report generation and export ( and ). Fixed missing  statements causing export failures. Strengthened AI prompt and added post-processing for markdown removal in reports.
-   **backend/store.py**: Manages MongoDB interactions and data persistence.
    -   **Importance**: Handles user data and productivity metrics.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to calculate time saved based on content length with reasonable caps and ensured  is always rounded to an integer for Pydantic compatibility.
-   **backend/rate_limiting.py**: Defines and enforces API rate limits.
    -   **Importance**: Prevents service abuse and ensures stability under load.
    -   **Changes**: Increased transcription API call limits (to 1000 calls/hour) to accommodate large file processing.
-   **frontend/src/App.js**: The main React application file.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates UI, routing, and client-side logic.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to utilize new backend comprehensive report export endpoints, correctly handles binary (blob) responses for Word/PDF. Modified UI text from Professional Report to Comprehensive Report and related button labels. Removed  and  client-side libraries after reverting to a backend-driven report generation. Enhanced error handling and debugging messages for report generation and AI chat. Fixed  to call the correct new backend endpoint.
-   **README.md**, **CHANGELOG.md**, **WORK_SUMMARY.md**: Core project documentation.
    -   **Importance**: Provides project overview, version history, and development summary.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with productivity metrics feature, recent enhancements, and versioning.
-   **PRODUCTIVITY_METRICS.md**: (NEW file) Dedicated documentation for the time-saved calculation.
    -   **Importance**: Details the new, content-based productivity metric algorithm.
-   **DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md**: (NEW file) Documents the reorganized project layout.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures clarity and consistency in the codebase structure.
-   **dev-tools/organize_files.py**: (NEW file) A utility script for ongoing file organization.
    -   **Importance**: Automates the cleanup of development artifacts in the root directory.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical deployment issue reported by the user. The user observed that their application, deployed at , was displaying a generic It works! page instead of the expected React application. This indicates a problem with how the  file (or the React build output) is being served or picked up during deployment. The AI engineer identified this as a potential misconfiguration or missing file in the deployment environment. The last action taken was to check the contents of the local source file  to understand its structure and content, which is a necessary preliminary step before diagnosing why it's not being deployed or rendered correctly in the production environment.
