The previous AI engineer tackled a broad range of tasks for the AUTO-ME PWA, encompassing feature enhancements, critical bug fixes, and security vulnerabilities. Work began with a React runtime error fix related to object rendering in JSX, progressing through report generation and stats authentication issues. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on debugging a persistent frontend login form submission failure, which directly impacted the user's ability to see correct metrics. The engineer also refactored the backend's rate-limiting system and resolved an Error loading jobs message due to authentication and overzealous security middleware. The current task involves addressing a broken OCR process, where  is missing but the system is attempting to use OpenAI's API, resulting in a 400 error. The engineer is actively diagnosing this OCR provider misconfiguration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that the **OCR process is broken**. Backend logs revealed a  error from  during an OCR attempt. The investigation determined that the  (for Google Cloud Vision API) is **not set**, yet the  function in  is configured to use the OpenAI Vision API () by default for OCR. This misconfiguration is causing the OCR failures. The engineer has identified the  function in  (specifically at line 263 onwards) as the source of this behavior and is currently examining its implementation to understand how it selects the OCR provider and to devise a fix. The goal is to ensure the OCR process uses the correct, configured API or provides clear error feedback when necessary keys are missing.
