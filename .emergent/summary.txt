The AI engineer systematically addressed several critical issues and feature requests, demonstrating adaptability to user feedback. Initially, the focus was on resolving persistent OCR failures due to OpenAI API rate limits, which was fixed by implementing robust exponential backoff and user notifications in  and . Subsequently, a Clean Up Failed Notes feature was added, including backend API endpoints () and a frontend UI (), enhancing data management.

A major shift occurred with the user's request for live, incremental transcription. This led to a comprehensive overhaul of the AI provider system, integrating  and Redis for real-time state management. New backend components (, , ) and frontend UI (, ) were developed. Throughout this, the engineer faced challenges with Redis configuration, API routing, and frontend event processing, requiring extensive debugging and refactoring, including fixing Redis data type parsing and event accumulation issues.

After persistent live transcription failures, the engineer pivoted to ensure the core voice capture worked reliably, removing hardcoded mock responses and reinforcing English-only transcription. The most recent task involves addressing confusing speaker diarization in large file transcriptions.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME PWA is a content capture application with Whisper transcription, OCR, text notes, email/Git sync, and JWT authentication. It aims for enterprise features like AI reports and a conversational AI agent.

Implemented features and addressed requests include:
-   **OCR Reliability**: Fixed OpenAI API 429 rate limit issues for OCR with exponential backoff and user notifications for delays. Optimized retry logic for faster processing.
-   **Note Management**: Added a Clean Up Failed Notes feature (backend endpoints, frontend UI) to remove stuck or failed notes. Implemented a Retry Processing button for stuck notes.
-   **Live Transcription**: Designed and partially implemented a real-time, incremental transcription system (streaming chunks, Redis state, real-time UI updates, instant finalization).
-   **AI Provider Robustness**: Integrated Emergent LLM key as a primary/fallback for AI analysis and reports, with OpenAI as a backup, to mitigate quota issues.
-   **Transcription Language Control**: Ensured OpenAI Whisper transcribes in English by explicitly setting the language parameter.
-   **Core Voice Capture Fixes**: Resolved issues where normal voice capture was failing or providing fake/incorrect language transcriptions due to live transcription development.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report about confusing Speaker 1: references appearing in large file transcriptions. The user uploaded a sample text artifact () which the engineer inspected, confirming the presence of Speaker 1: and Speaker 2: labels along with repetitive phrases, making the output confusing.

The current task involves identifying where this speaker diarization is being applied within the large file transcription system (likely in the backend processing pipeline, potentially within  or ) and removing it. This needs to be done carefully to ensure the core transcription functionality remains intact. This directly follows a series of fixes related to transcription language (forcing English) and general reliability of the normal voice capture process, which was previously impacted by issues introduced during the development of the live transcription feature.
