The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and enhanced the AUTO-ME PWA across several critical areas. Initially, the focus was on debugging large file transcription issues, which ultimately led to a frontend-specific bug related to polling and error handling. This was resolved with improved client-side logic and  configurations. Subsequently, significant effort was dedicated to refining batch report generation, including structuring the output, adding Ask AI functionality, visual indicators for batched notes, and ensuring proper note completion status.

A recurring challenge involved the Forgot Password feature, which faced persistent UI visibility issues due to a critical oversight: the application was using  while the engineer was modifying . Once this was identified and corrected, the full password reset flow was implemented. Database cleanup, productivity metrics, and robust error handling for authentication processes were also addressed. The work demonstrates an iterative, detail-oriented approach to debugging and feature implementation, often requiring deep dives into both frontend and backend code, and interaction with the user for clarification and validation. The most recent task involves improving the formatting of AI-generated Word reports.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME PWA is a zero-friction content capture application designed for guaranteed delivery and editable AI outputs. Its core features include Whisper transcription, OCR, text notes, email/Git synchronization, JWT authentication, and data isolation. The application aims to evolve with enterprise features such as IISB analysis, dynamic theming, multi-file upload, AI professional reports, and a conversational Ask AI agent. A recent major focus was on developing a large-file audio transcription pipeline.

Explicit requests and features that have been implemented or addressed so far include:
-   **Large File Transcription Reliability**: Debugged and stabilized recurring Error loading jobs and Could not fetch transcription jobs issues for large uploads.
-   **Batch Report Enhancements**: Structured output, added Ask AI Agent functionality, visual batch indicators, ensured notes are marked complete post-export, and fixed AI Report button errors.
-   **Productivity Metrics**: Implemented a real-time, automatic system to track productivity gains (time saved) upon note completion, stored in user profiles.
-   **Password Management**: Implemented a Forgot Password feature with email validation and a password reset flow, accessible from the login screen and user profile, and fixed associated React runtime errors.
-   **Database Cleanup**: Provided and executed a mechanism to completely delete all notes and transcription jobs, ensuring a clean database for deployment.
-   **Text Formatting**: Improved paragraph formatting for all text exports (TXT, RTF, DOC, AI reports) to ensure a professional layout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to enhance the Ask AI functionality's Word document output. The user reported that the current Word output for AI analysis was all condensed, no proper paragraphs, headings are squared - so format this for a better professional layout. The AI engineer has acknowledged this issue, confirming that the AI Content Analysis modal and export functionality are working, but the Word document formatting needs improvement. The engineer's last action was to download and examine the user-provided Word document to understand the current formatting issues before proceeding with the fix. This task directly follows the successful resolution of all React runtime errors across user registration, login, and forgot password flows, making the authentication system robust. The database has also been completely cleaned.

<optional_next_step>
Examine the downloaded Word document and then modify the  (or relevant batch AI export) function in  to produce a professional layout with proper paragraphs and formatted headings.
