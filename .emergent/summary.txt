The AI engineer successfully guided the AUTO-ME PWA through significant feature additions and critical bug fixes, starting from Phase 2 of the large-file audio transcription pipeline. Initially, Phase 2, 3, and 4 (Enhanced Upload System, Job Pipeline Architecture, Advanced Processing, Production Features) were implemented, adding resumable uploads, a robust worker system, multi-format outputs (TXT, JSON, SRT, VTT, DOCX), diarization, language detection, object storage, caching, monitoring, rate limiting, and webhooks.

Post-implementation, a series of bugs emerged. Key issues included: frontend upload not progressing due to a race condition, backend finalization failing due to incorrect file handling ( vs. file object),  errors on retry due to lost file references, pipeline stages misfiring ( calls not ed, missing job data paths), and incorrect progress reporting in the UI. A major recurring error was  missing , and finally, a critical  event loop conflict in  which caused jobs to stall. Each bug required deep-dives, specific code modifications, and often, restarts to verify fixes. The work culminated in fixing the event loop conflict, clearing the path for successful job processing.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME app is a productivity tool for zero-friction content capture (voice, photo, text) with guaranteed delivery and trustworthy, editable AI outputs. Core features include voice transcription (OpenAI Whisper), OCR (OpenAI Vision), direct text notes, email sharing, Git sync, JWT authentication, and data isolation. Enterprise features include IISB analysis, dynamic theming, multi-file upload, and AI-powered professional reports. A conversational Ask AI agent offers context-rich analysis and structured meeting minutes. User personalization via professional/industry profiling tailors AI responses. The export system was overhauled to remove markdown. Bug fixes addressed large audio processing, background task errors, batch report validation, mobile responsiveness, and persistent runtime errors. A bulletproof service monitoring system and robust large file handling were critical for reliability. The latest requirement is a comprehensive Large-file audio transcription pipeline supporting resumable uploads, asynchronous processing, multi-format outputs (TXT, JSON, SRT, VTT, DOCX), multi-speaker diarization, language detection, resume-from-failure, and enhanced security/privacy, all completed through Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the final test of the large-file audio transcription pipeline using the small test audio file, verifying successful processing and output generation.
- Implement any further UI/UX enhancements or optimizations for the real-time progress bar.
- Address any remaining edge cases or minor bugs that may arise during further testing of the complete pipeline.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in deep-diving to fix a critical  event loop conflict that prevented transcription jobs from progressing. The user reported Failling, loads of errors and jobs being stuck in PENDING. The root cause was identified as , specifically within the  function in . This function was incorrectly attempting to run an event loop in an already async context, leading to pipeline stalls.

The AI engineer addressed this by modifying  to make  truly synchronous, directly accessing the local file system path without any asynchronous operations ( or ). This fix is crucial for the pipeline's stability and proper execution.

The current work concluded with restarting the backend and setting up a small test audio file () to perform a final verification of the complete, end-to-end transcription pipeline, now that the critical event loop conflict is resolved.
