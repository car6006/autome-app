The AI engineer systematically tackled multiple issues and feature requests. Initially, a critical transcription failure due to  and  errors was debugged and fixed by ensuring  validation and  robustness, and by resolving a duplicate  call. Subsequently, UI/UX enhancements were implemented: removal of download buttons, streamlining the actions dropdown (removing Generate Meeting Minutes, Generate Action Items, renaming Professional Report to Detailed Report), and adding a mobile-friendly Share button.

A major development phase involved implementing three key user-requested features: Search functionality for notes (client-side), a comprehensive Tagging System (backend  field, API endpoints, frontend UI), and a Template Options system (backend model, CRUD APIs, frontend modals for creation and management). During templates development, a critical React Invalid hook call error was introduced and fixed by correctly placing  calls. Finally, the AI engineer addressed several mobile responsiveness issues and restored temporarily disappeared Profile and Help buttons due to authentication logic. The last action was updating comprehensive documentation for all changes.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME PWA is a content capture application with Whisper transcription, OCR, text notes, email/Git sync, and JWT authentication, aiming for enterprise features like AI reports. Initial requests included fixing OCR reliability, adding note management (cleanup/retry), and building live transcription.

**Implemented features include:**
*   **OCR & Transcription Reliability**: Resolved OpenAI API rate limits and PosixPath/NoneType transcription failures. Added M4A to WAV conversion for broader audio format support. Ensured English-only transcription.
*   **Note Management**: Clean Up Failed Notes and Retry Processing for stuck notes.
*   **Live Transcription (Partial)**: Designed for real-time, incremental transcription.
*   **AI Provider Robustness**: Integrated  for LLM with fallback mechanisms.
*   **UI/UX Streamlining**: Removed download buttons from large file transcription, removed Generate Meeting Minutes and Generate Action Items from the notes dropdown, renamed Professional Report to Detailed Report, added a mobile-friendly Share button.
*   **Core Productivity Features**: Implemented client-side **Search Functionality** for notes, a full-stack **Tagging System** (add/remove, filter, suggestions), and a **Template Options** system (create, manage, apply templates).
*   **Mobile Experience**: Improved bottom navigation, moved Profile/Help buttons to header (with login fallback), and fixed React hook call errors affecting overall mobile rendering.

<pending_tasks>
-   Further improve live transcription UI/UX with session validation, auto-restart capabilities, and clearer error messages for expired sessions. (This was mentioned early and not explicitly addressed later).
-   Investigate confusing Speaker 1: references from large file transcription output (mentioned in initial analysis, but pivoted to transcription failures).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just finished fixing a critical bug where the Profile and ? (Help/Documentation) buttons had disappeared from the UI for unauthenticated users, which was a regression introduced during mobile responsiveness enhancements.

The fix involved restoring the Help button as a floating element and placing the Profile/Login button back into the bottom navigation, ensuring both are visible regardless of authentication status. This was done to address the user's explicit report of the buttons disappearing, confirming the system is now visually stable. Following this, the user requested a full documentation update to reflect all the recent extensive changes and enhancements, which the AI engineer promptly completed by generating five detailed markdown files covering completion summary, mobile responsiveness, changelog, API documentation, and deployment guide. This marks the conclusion of a significant development phase.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user that the restored Profile and Help buttons are visible and that the new documentation meets their needs, then propose the next set of features.
