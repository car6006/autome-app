The previous AI engineer performed extensive work across several critical areas. Initially, fixes for persistent transcription issues were implemented, including resolving corrupted audio chunking leading to repetitive You You You output by refining FFmpeg parameters and adding validation in . Comprehensive file format support was added, moving from limited formats to universal acceptance and backend MP3 conversion, coupled with robust error handling. UI/UX was significantly refined, focusing on mobile responsiveness, a streamlined bottom navigation, and a global hamburger menu. Branding was consistently updated from AI to AUTO-ME across various UI elements and export features. Furthermore, YouTube Processing and Live Transcription features were systematically removed from both frontend and backend. The latest efforts focused on enhancing the Productivity Analytics page by adding weekly/monthly usage graphs, with the current task centered on making these graphs functional using actual user data, which entails creating new backend analytics endpoints.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME PWA aims to be a robust content capture application with enterprise-grade AI reports, supporting OCR, Whisper transcription, text notes, email/Git sync, and JWT authentication. Key user requirements and implemented features include:

1.  **Reliable Transcription**: Fixed You You You output and corrupted audio for long recordings (2-hour meetings), requiring robust audio chunking and processing.
2.  **Universal File Support**: Expanded support for diverse audio/video formats (M4A, MP4, FLAC, etc.) for large file uploads, including automatic backend conversion to MP3.
3.  **Refined UI/UX**: Streamlined navigation with a compact bottom bar (Record, Scan, Notes) and a global hamburger menu for other features. Improved mobile responsiveness, including notes scrolling.
4.  **Cleaner Reports**: Enhanced batch report formatting by removing unnecessary dividers, using note titles as report names, and improving paragraph structure.
5.  **Branding Consistency**: Replaced all AI references with AUTO-ME in UI, processing indicators, buttons, modal descriptions, and export filenames.
6.  **Processing Visibility**: Added persistent visual indicators for Detailed Report generation, showing status outside dropdown menus.
7.  **Feature Removal**: Systematically removed YouTube Processing and Live Transcription features from the application.
8.  **Archive Management Fix**: Corrected a backend validation error for  in  endpoint.
9.  **Analytics Dashboard**: Implemented usage graphs (weekly/monthly trends) on the Productivity Analytics page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with making the newly implemented weekly and monthly usage graphs on the **Productivity Analytics page** functional with actual user data.

Previously, the engineer had successfully:
1.  **Implemented the UI for analytics**: Added new charting components (, , ) and various sections (Weekly Usage Trends, Monthly Overview, Daily Activity Heatmap, Performance Insights) to the  component in . This involved setting up the visual structure and integrating a charting library.
2.  **Restarted the frontend**: To apply these UI changes, making the graphs visible with sample data.

The current work involves the backend to support these new frontend analytics. The engineer's very last action was:
-   **Starting to create backend analytics endpoints**: This is the initial step to fetch real usage data from the application's database (MongoDB) that will populate the graphs and make them dynamic, reflecting actual user activity. The backend was restarted in preparation for these new endpoints.
