The previous AI engineer successfully tackled a range of critical bugs and feature enhancements. Initially, they resolved persistent YouTube audio extraction failures (403 errors) by implementing robust cookie-based authentication, fallback strategies, and refined error handling in . Concurrently, the UI was significantly improved with a global, responsive hamburger menu consolidating features and streamlining the bottom navigation. A major reliability issue with long recordings failing was addressed by adopting large file processing principles, including extended timeouts, smart chunking, and background processing. Critical security flaw of notes exposure post-logout was fixed by introducing authentication checks and state clearing. Additionally, the screen's wake lock during recording was enhanced, and a bug causing markdown symbols in exported reports was resolved by comprehensive cleaning. The latest work focuses on fixing a transcription catastrophe (repetitive You You You output) by correcting corrupted audio chunking in  and adding chunk validation, indicating a deep dive into audio processing core.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME PWA is a content capture application with enterprise features like AI reports. It supports OCR, Whisper transcription, text notes, email/Git sync, and JWT authentication. Previous work focused on reliability, note management, partial live transcription, AI provider robustness, and UI/UX improvements.

User requests in this trajectory:
1.  **Live Transcription Fix**: Improve real-time transcription by reducing audio chunk size to 5 seconds, propagating this setting, and documenting it for Samsung system-like feedback.
2.  **System Enhancement vs. Smart Notes**: Surpass competitors by implementing YouTube/video URL transcription, improved PDF/DOCX support, advanced AI chat, multi-language translation, and a UI refresh.
3.  **YouTube URL Processing & UI Sprush Up**: Implement YouTube audio extraction for transcription and create an aesthetically pleasing menu-style interface for features.
4.  **Application Environment Readiness**: Prepare the app for both the current environment and GitHub Codespaces, including a rollback timestamp.
5.  **Long Recording Reliability**: Implement foolproof background processing for regular Record functionality, similar to Large Files, to prevent failures for recordings over 1 hour.
6.  **Streamlined Navigation**: Redesign the bottom navigation to only include Record (center, larger), Scan, and Notes, moving other features to the hamburger menu.
7.  **Export Format Cleanliness**: Ensure exported batch reports are truly clean, removing all markdown symbols (e.g., , ).
8.  **Expanded File Format Support**: Broaden supported file types for large uploads to prevent Unsupported file type errors, including M4A and various video formats.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a transcription catastrophe reported by the user, where a 2-hour meeting recording resulted in nonsensical output (You You You and Silence). This pointed to a severe bug in the audio processing pipeline.

The engineer, after consulting the , identified the root cause as **corrupted audio chunking** within the ffmpeg process in . Specifically, the aggressive resampling parameters () were destroying audio quality, leading to uninterpretable chunks for the Whisper API.

The current work involves implementing fixes for this critical audio chunking issue:
1.  **Correcting ffmpeg command**: The command in  is being modified to remove the aggressive resampling parameters, preserving original audio quality during chunking.
2.  **Adding chunk validation**: Logic is being added to  to detect corrupted audio chunks, which will help in future debugging and error handling.
3.  **Missing  import**: The very last action noted a missing  import in , which is likely required for the new chunk validation or error recovery logic being implemented.

This work aims to ensure that audio chunks are correctly generated and passed to the transcription service, preventing the repetitive You You You output and making the transcription process reliable for all audio types, especially long recordings.
