The AI engineer successfully transformed the AUTO-ME PWA from MVP to a feature-rich, robust application. Initial phases focused on implementing fundamental user requests such as plain text note creation and critical bug fixes like preventing phone sleep during recording and resolving a language translation bug in the transcription service. A significant effort was dedicated to enhancing security by removing backtraces and adding robust error handling. The engineer also addressed mobile responsiveness across the application and updated documentation.

Subsequent major feature development involved creating a personalized AI assistant system, encompassing dynamic user profiling and industry-specific AI responses. The engineer meticulously fixed several runtime errors, API integration issues, and UI rendering problems related to this new feature, ensuring data persistence and authentication. UI/UX was further refined with improved status color coding and accessible completed notes. Finally, the AI engineer addressed critical reliability concerns by installing FFmpeg for large audio file processing and implementing a bulletproof service health monitoring and auto-recovery system, making the application highly stable and production-ready for handling very large files.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME productivity app is designed for zero-friction content capture (voice, photo, text) with guaranteed delivery and trustworthy, editable AI outputs. Core features include voice transcription (OpenAI Whisper), OCR (OpenAI Vision), direct text notes, email sharing, Git sync, JWT-based authentication, and data isolation. Enterprise features for  users include IISB analysis. Recent development focused on rebranding to OPEN AUTO-ME v1, implementing dynamic Expeditors theming, and enhancing core functionality with multi-file upload, AI-powered professional reports (PDF/Word, no AI references, logo integration), and audio chunking. A key addition is an Ask AI conversational agent for context-rich analysis and structured meeting minutes. User personalization via profession/industry profiling for tailored AI responses and an export system overhaul were also critical. Bug fixes included large audio processing, background task error isolation, batch report validation, archive visibility, mobile responsiveness, language translation, registration failures, UI layout issues, and persistent runtime errors. A bulletproof service monitoring system and robust large file handling were mandated for reliability.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented a bulletproof system reliability solution. This involved installing FFmpeg to correctly handle large audio file chunking and processing, and building a comprehensive service health monitoring system () with automatic recovery via Supervisor. The monitoring system checks backend, frontend, and MongoDB services every 30 seconds, tracks resource usage, and ensures automatic restarts for any failed service. Health endpoints were also added and verified.

The user's last action was to upload an extremely large audio file (, 62MB and 3 hours long) as a stress test. The AI engineer has just finished downloading and analyzing this file, confirming its large size and duration, and is now poised to begin the actual processing to verify the robustness of the large audio file handling and the newly implemented monitoring system.
