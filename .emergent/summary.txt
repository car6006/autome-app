<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the AUTO-ME productivity PWA from MVP to a production-ready state, addressing numerous bugs and implementing significant new features. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes, including rectifying database cleanup accidental deletion, resolving backend processing issues (file handling, email, storage URLs, datetime serialization), and fixing frontend UI/UX problems (unauthenticated access, recording limits, scan file upload, export, editing, help guide, audio waveform, responsiveness). A major pivot involved replacing the failing Google Cloud Vision API with OpenAI Vision for OCR, leveraging existing OpenAI keys. Subsequently, the application was enhanced with key features: multi-file upload for handwritten notes, AI-powered professional report generation with rich-text formatting, and audio file upload capabilities on both Record and Network pages. Large audio file processing (exceeding 25MB) was solved via automatic chunking using FFmpeg, and transcription timeouts were resolved with dynamic adjustments. The process was iterative, involving frequent user feedback and systematic debugging. The immediate next step involves removing all Emergent branding from the application.

<product_requirements>
The AUTO-ME productivity app aims to offer zero-friction content capture (voice, photo), guaranteed delivery, trustworthy outputs (diarization, OCR, in-app edits), measurable impact (analytics), and enterprise readiness (POPIA, audit logs, access controls).
The initial PWA (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) included:
- Core productivity: Voice transcription (OpenAI Whisper), OCR (Google Cloud Vision, later OpenAI Vision), email sharing (SendGrid), Git sync, basic analytics.
- User management: JWT-based authentication, user profiles, data isolation.
- Enterprise features for  users: Hidden Network Diagram mapping tool, IISB (Issues, Impact, Solutions, Benefits) analysis tool.

Recent feature additions and bug fixes covered:
- Multi-file upload for handwritten notes.
- AI-powered professional reports with insights and action items.
- Audio file upload to Record and Network pages.
- Large audio file processing (chunking).
- Rich-text output for professional reports.
- Comprehensive Help/Guide component.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a bug where exported files had generic UUID filenames. This was fixed by modifying the backend endpoint ( in ) to retrieve and use the note's title for the filename. Concurrently, the frontend's  function (in ) was updated to pass the note's title to the backend, ensuring proper filename generation for both individual and batch reports.

The user's very last explicit request was: I want to share my preview with someone but dont want them to see any reference to Emergent, yet, how can I. This indicates that the current work involves identifying and removing all instances of Emergent branding or references from the application's frontend and potentially backend for a clean, brand-neutral preview.
